    "This code sets up a LangChain agent using the **zero-shot-react-description** strategy. The agent is initialized with two tools:\n",

    "- `search_tool`: Likely used for querying recent web-based information (e.g., SpaceX launch).\n",
    "- `get_system_time`: A utility to fetch the current time.\n",

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying Starlink satellites lifts off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Dec. 31, 2024, marking the company's 134th and last launch of the year. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch the second of the two-satellite Sentinel-6 series. NASA awarded SpaceX a $94 million firm fixed price contract for the launch in 2022. That means tonight's Starlink mission countdown is locked in to lift off at 9:17 p.m. without any delays, or else the launch must be postponed to a later date. Next SpaceX launch may be Saturday ...
